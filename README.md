## How it works: 

### After Logging in, it brings you to the home page (pictured below) and you add movies to your TOP 5, through the search bar. If for some reason, your movie doesn't come up you can add it through the ADD TO FAVORITES button. Once it opens up on new page rendering all your favorite movies, you can update it or delete it by using the designated buttons. Once you're done you can update it if one of the movies changes.
